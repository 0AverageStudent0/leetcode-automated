# Azure OpenAI Analysis: ### Summary
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: This solution attempts to compute how many water bottles can be drunk given an initial number of full bottles (`numBottles`) and a trade-in rate (`numExchange`) for empty bottles. The logic aims to simulate the process of drinking bottles and exchanging empties for new full bottles until no further exchanges are possible.
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: 
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: ### Strengths
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: - The solution is concise and uses a straightforward simulation approach.
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: - It maintains a running count of drunk bottles and empty bottles effectively.
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: 
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: ### Weaknesses
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: - The key logic for exchanging empty bottles is incorrect. It only performs one exchange at a time (`empty -= numExchange` and `numBottles += 1`) instead of performing as many exchanges as possible.
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: - The solution incorrectly increments `numExchange` inside the loop (`numExchange += 1`), which is logically wrong since the exchange rate remains constant.
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: - The loop might not terminate correctly because `numExchange` increases, which can cause an infinite loop or incorrect results.
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: - The code does not handle cases where multiple exchanges can be done simultaneously on a single iteration, reducing efficiency and correctness.
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: 
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: ### Suggestions for Improvement
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: - Remove the line that increments `numExchange` inside the loop.
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: - Update the logic to exchange as many empty bottles as possible in each iteration with integer division:
# Azure OpenAI Analysis:   
# Azure OpenAI Analysis:   ```python
# Azure OpenAI Analysis:   new_bottles = empty // numExchange
# Azure OpenAI Analysis:   empty = (empty % numExchange) + new_bottles
# Azure OpenAI Analysis:   numBottles = new_bottles
# Azure OpenAI Analysis:   ```
# Azure OpenAI Analysis:   
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: - Continue looping until no new bottles can be obtained (`numBottles == 0`).
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: - Consider renaming variables for clarity (e.g., `empty` -> `empty_bottles`).
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: 
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: ### Corrected Code Example
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: 
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: ```python
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: class Solution:
# Azure OpenAI Analysis:     def maxBottlesDrunk(self, numBottles: int, numExchange: int) -> int:
# Azure OpenAI Analysis:         empty = 0
# Azure OpenAI Analysis:         drunk = 0
# Azure OpenAI Analysis:         while numBottles > 0:
# Azure OpenAI Analysis:             drunk += numBottles
# Azure OpenAI Analysis:             empty += numBottles
# Azure OpenAI Analysis:             numBottles = empty // numExchange
# Azure OpenAI Analysis:             empty = empty % numExchange
# Azure OpenAI Analysis:         return drunk
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: ```
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: 
# Azure OpenAI Analysis: This makes sure that all possible exchanges happen each iteration and the logic remains correct and efficient.

class Solution:
    def maxBottlesDrunk(self, numBottles: int, numExchange: int) -> int:
        empty = 0
        drunk = 0
        while numBottles > 0:
            drunk += numBottles
            empty += numBottles
            numBottles = 0

            if empty >= numExchange:
                empty -= numExchange
                numBottles += 1
                numExchange += 1
        return drunk
